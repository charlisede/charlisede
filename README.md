# Charles D'Harrington | Biomolecular Scientist & Aspiring Computational Scientist

### Bridging the gap between the wet lab and the command line.

<br>

I am an industrial scientist with a deep background in molecular biology, gene therapy, NGS, and GxP-regulated environments. My foundational belief is that the next great breakthroughs in biology will not come from the lab or the computer alone, but from the seamless fusion of both. My mission is to become a leader in that fusion.

I am currently building a comprehensive computational toolkit by pursuing two intensive career paths: **Machine Learning Engineering** and **Full-Stack Software Engineering**. This journey is in preparation for my **PhD in Engineering Mathematics**, where I will apply these skills to solve high-value problems in synthetic biology and therapeutic development.

This GitHub profile is a real-time log of that journey.

### üèÜ Key Achievements & Impact

My work has been focused on translating complex science into real-world impact. I have had the privilege of contributing to several critical therapeutic projects, including:

* **Global Health Crisis Response:** Played a key role in the quality control and release of **100 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine**, underscoring my ability to deliver under pressure in a globally significant project.
* **Pioneering Gene Therapy:** Supported the **Phase 3 clinical trials for a novel gene therapy (FCX-007)** for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa, a devastating genetic skin disorder.
* **Advancing Cancer Treatment:** Key contributor to the **method validation for a novel manufacturing process** that optimised the production of a **multiple myeloma gene therapy**, directly contributing to the fight against a complex cancer.
* **Genomic Service Leadership:** As a key member of a high-throughput sequencing facility, I act as a "genomic guide" for researchers, harnessing **Illumina, Nanopore, and 10X Genomics** platforms to accelerate research in virology, immunology, and vaccine development.
